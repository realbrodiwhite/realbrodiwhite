# Jeremy "Brodi White" Beebe

> ⚙️ "Why would I choose to break things when I was presented with the opportunity to build things instead?"

Hi, I’m **Jeremy Beebe**, aka **Brodi White** — a systems thinker, creative technologist, and AI-native problem solver. I design and deploy solutions that are beautiful, bold, and radically user-aligned. I live in rural Southern Colorado but operate on a global scale. Find me across the web at **[@realbrodiwhite](https://github.com/realbrodiwhite)**.

- **Invent** products, systems, and platforms that bridge tech with culture  
- **Build** full-stack applications, automation pipelines, and smart hardware

### 🌀 My Process: The Iteration Loop  
I run a rare, _ultra-productive_ ideation cycle — a blend of:  
- 🔁 Micro-iteration: Rapid problem-solving across creative & technical layers  
- 🧠 Macro-visioning: Intuition-led innovation grounded in research and constraints  
- 🚀 Execution: From whiteboard to GitHub in 24-72 hours — minimal fluff, max momentum
