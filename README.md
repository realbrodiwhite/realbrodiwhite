🧠 **Who I Am**  
A builder, problem-solver, and unorthodox engineer. I specialize in turning raw chaos into structured brilliance. At 33, I'm rewriting what it means to invent on your own terms.

🌱 Born in California, rooted in a rural Colorado town — but my reach is global.

⚡ **What I Do Best**  
- 🔁 **Rare iterative/ideation cycle**: I can run loops from napkin sketch → full deployable system in hours, not weeks.
- 🧪 Rapid prototyping across multiple domains: hardware, software, smart homes, and embedded systems.
- 🤖 AI systems + prompt architecture, pipeline design (LangChain, Wordware, Supabase, Vercel, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- 💬 Creative strategy for artists & entrepreneurs (238k+ organic streams in 90 days on recent rap projects).
- 🌐 Building everything from **military-grade drones** to **self-sustaining towns** — with AI woven into the infrastructure.

📁 **Notable Projects**  
| Project | Description | Stack |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **UMÄO** | A universal AI collaboration platform connecting multiple LLMs with shared memory, tools, and real-time agent handoff. | GPT-4, Claude, Supabase, Vercel, LangChain |
| **Cubex Ecosystem** | A scalable robotics + drone + wearable + AI agent platform with military/civilian tiers. | Embedded Linux, CAN, vision AI, radios |
| **Built By Brodi** | My design/development brand that fuses software, lifestyle branding, and utility. | Full-stack + creative tools |
| **Solvine** | Bioengineered CO₂-consuming bovine project. Yes, really. | Genetics, AI modeling, agri-tech |

💭 **“We don’t build things for clout. We build them for culture.”**

Want me to auto-generate this into a GitHub profile README repo and prep your markdown file? I can set that up for you, or even tailor a second version for commercial collabs or investor decks.
