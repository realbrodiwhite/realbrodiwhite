- 👋 Hey, I'm Jeremy "Brodi White" Beebe. Find me everywhere @realbrodiwhite.
- ✨ At 33, I'm an American on the lookout for more rewarding career opportunities.
- 🌎 Born and raised in California, I now reside in a close-knit farming community in Southern Colorado.
- 👀 My interests range from devops to space, mechanical engineering, botany, rap music & hoodrat things (quite the eclectic mix!).
- 👨‍💻 Learning is my constant state; I voraciously consume documentation, manuals, videos, and other educational content.
- 💞️ I'm eager to collaborate and contribute to something that is greater than myself.
- 📫 Want to get in touch? You can reach me at brodiwhite951@gmail.com or brodibranded@gmail.com.

- I aspire to assist, and at absolute minimum, witness the human race colonize mars. Less lofty, I invent or optimize things for "fun" in my free time, automating the farming industry through various methods of mechanical automation, pairing Artificial Intelligence with Swarm Inspired architecture and problem solving, incorporating smaller form factors, permaculture, integrated pest management techniques and a more local and family managable farming model.
