- 👋 Hey, I'm Jeremy "Brodi White" Beebe. Find me everywhere @realbrodiwhite.
- ✨ At 33, I'm an American on the lookout for more rewarding career opportunities.
- 🌎 Born and raised in California, I now reside in a close-knit farming community in Southern Colorado.
- 👀 My interests range from devops to space, mechanical engineering, botany, rap music & hoodrat things (quite the eclectic mix!).
- 👨‍💻 Learning is my constant state; I voraciously consume documentation, manuals, videos, and other educational content.
- 💞️ I'm eager to collaborate and contribute to something that is greater than myself.
- 📫 Want to get in touch? You can reach me at brodiwhite951@gmail.com or brodibranded@gmail.com.
