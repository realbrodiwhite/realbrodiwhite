Jeremy "Brodi White" Beebe

> ⚙️ "Why would I choose to break things when I was presented with the opportunity to build things instead?"



Hi, I’m Jeremy Beebe, aka Brodi White — a systems thinker, creative technologist, and AI-native problem solver. I design and deploy solutions that are beautiful, bold, and radically user-aligned. I live in rural Southern Colorado but operate on a global scale. You can find me across the web at @realbrodiwhite.

✨ What I Do

Invent products, systems, and platforms that bridge tech with culture

Build full-stack applications, automation pipelines, and smart hardware

Contribute to major open source projects like AutoGen (Microsoft), Rancher, Web Studio, and Strapi

Strategize brand identities and user flows as an experienced designer-marketer hybrid


🌀 My Process: The Iteration Loop

I run a rare, ultra-productive ideation cycle — a blend of:

🔁 Micro-iteration: Rapid problem-solving loops across creative & technical layers

🧠 Macro-visioning: Intuition-led innovation grounded in research and constraints

🚀 Execution: From whiteboard to GitHub in 24-72 hours — minimal fluff, max momentum


This loop helps me ship with purpose, learn in public, and optimize on-the-fly.

🛠️ Tech I Use & Love

These are the tools I wield like second nature — spanning full-stack apps, cloud backends, and AI system architecture:












🎯 Current Focus

Scaling UMÄO — an AI-native operating system for multi-agent collaboration

Building smart home hardware, autonomous robotic assistants, and off-grid compute infrastructure

Developing open-source tooling for lead funnels, media production, and data visualization
